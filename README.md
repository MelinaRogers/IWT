# IWT (I Was There)

## Grateful Dead Show Dashboard

IWT is a React-based dashboard that allows heads to track and visualize their show count. Select the shows you've attended and generate personalized statistics. It was originally developed because people would comment "IWT" under different shows, and I always wanted to create a Spotify Wrapped style shareable tab for heads.

### Features

- Select Grateful Dead shows from a comprehensive database
- Generate statistics based on your attended shows
- View visualizations of your concert experiences
- Track your tour over time
